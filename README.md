--Installation Guide--

1. Install node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (the .msi installer and either 32 bit/64 bit depending on your Windows installation).

2. Download the zip file and extract to wherever you want.

3. In the root of the castertool-master folder shift + rightclick and open a powershell window.

4. Type "NPM install" and hit enter (the installation will take a while).

5. Once installed type "npm start". After a short time a browser tab will open and the app is good to go :) (npm start is how you start it from now on via the powershell window).
